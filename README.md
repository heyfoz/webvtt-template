Web Video Text Track (WebVTT / .vtt) files are utilized to add closed captions to web videos by specifying what text to display during designated time periods. Using this type of file with web videos can enhance accessibility and productivity. The webvtt-template repository contains an example of a WebVTT file using a NOTE comment and closed captions in English.
